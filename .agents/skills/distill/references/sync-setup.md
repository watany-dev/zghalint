# distill — fleet sync setup (the pack as a private repo)

Distilled **global** skills live in the pack `~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills/`. The pack is
also a `@skills-dir` plugin, so every machine that has the folder loads the skills natively — no install.

> **⚠️ Durability first, sync second.** A remote is **required for durability**, not a sync nicety: until
> the pack has a remote, the distilled skills are a **single on-disk copy** — one `rm -rf ~/.claude/skills`
> or disk failure from total loss. Set up the remote **before** you rely on distilled skills. (Skills are
> committed at approval time — `commit-on-approve` — so they survive concurrency/crashes locally; the
> remote is what survives losing the whole machine.)

> **Fastest path — use the script.** `scripts/distill-sync-setup.sh` does every git step below
> deterministically and idempotently: `status` (what's set up?), `init-remote <url>` (machine #1
> backup), `enroll <url>` (new machine), `fix-gitignore [repo]` (track project-scoped skills with
> the *correct* negation). The manual commands below are the same steps, for reference / no-script
> environments. `/autopilot:distill` invokes the script automatically on first run (Step 5).

## Running distill on another machine (contribute, not just consume)
Cloning the pack only lets a machine **consume** the existing skills. To also **distill on it** — mine
*that machine's own* conversation history into new skills — do the full onboarding once:

1. **Install autopilot** on that machine — the `distill` skill (the factory) ships with it.
2. **Clone the pack** to `~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills/` (see Option A below) — distill
   writes approved global skills there. (First-ever `~/.claude/skills/` creation → one CC restart.)
3. Nothing to configure for identifier safety — and that is deliberate. `scripts/identifier-scan.js`
   catches structured tokens only; the machine's real hostnames and client names are caught by the
   **human review gate in Step 3**, never by a per-machine list. (A deny-list would silently pass
   every name it was not told and still report "clean" — rejected under ADR-0001; see
   `references/knowledge-routing.md` §5.)
4. Run **`/autopilot:distill`** — it scans *this* machine's `~/.claude/projects/`, proposes candidates
   from its own history, you approve, and it writes them into the cloned pack (global) or the relevant
   project's `.claude/skills/`.
5. `git push` the pack → other machines `git pull` and gain the new skills.

Each machine distills its **own** history; the pack accumulates every machine's approved skills (union
by skill directory). If two machines distil the *same* procedure, the slug normalizer makes them land on
one path and `/distill` **consolidates them automatically** before pushing — `distill-consolidate.sh
compare <slug>` detects the divergent upstream variant in the clean working tree, then a human-gated LLM
merge writes the canonical (no merge-conflict state is ever entered). See SKILL.md Step 5.

## Option A — private git repo (recommended for an async fleet)
A remote is always-on store-and-forward, so machines that are on at different times still converge.

**One-time, machine 1 (where the pack already exists):**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills
# create a PRIVATE repo on your host (no gh? create it in the web UI, then:)
git remote add origin git@github.com:<you>/autopilot-distill-skills.git
git push -u origin main        # sets upstream; first-run guard for later pulls
```

**One-time, every other machine (fleet enrollment):**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<you>/autopilot-distill-skills.git \
  ~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills
```
Creating `~/.claude/skills/` for the first time needs one Claude Code restart to be watched.

**Routine (any machine):**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills
git pull --rebase      # has-upstream guaranteed by the -u push above
# (distill writes/commits a new skill here) → git push
```
Auth: use an SSH deploy key or a PAT in your credential store per host (no `gh` required). Per-skill
subdirectories mean a new skill from machine A and one from machine B never touch the same file — a
plain pull/push merges cleanly. When two machines distil the *same* procedure (same normalized slug),
`/distill` consolidates them automatically at push time (SKILL.md Step 5, `distill-consolidate.sh`).

**One-time migration (packs created before slug-normalization):**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-<plugin>}/scripts/distill-consolidate.sh migrate   # git mv staged
git commit -am "distill: normalize skill slugs" && git push
```
Renames existing dirs (`fix-git-identity` → `git-identity`) **and rewrites each frontmatter `name:`** to
the canonical slug so future cross-machine compares line up (a skill's identity is its `name:`). If two existing dirs normalize to the same slug it STOPs (a real consolidation case —
resolve by hand; don't let `migrate` merge them).

## Fleet rollback — a bad consolidation that already pushed
The consolidate write is a **normal commit** (not a merge commit), so a plain revert works:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills
git revert <bad-sha> && git push    # other machines absorb the revert on their next pull
```
The propagation channel that spread the bad canonical also spreads the fix. **Caveat — descendant
case**: if another machine *already pulled the bad canonical and re-consolidated on top of it*, the
revert lands as a fresh same-slug conflict on that machine → it STOPs for manual resolution (the engine
never auto-merges a revert). Revert promptly to stay ahead of peers.

## Option B — Syncthing (no git, P2P, no cloud)
Share the `~/.claude/skills/autopilot-distill-skills/` folder between machines. Caveat: both ends must
be online simultaneously to converge (no store-and-forward) — worse for an async/time-zone-split fleet.

## Project-scoped skills need no setup — UNLESS the project gitignores `.claude/`
Skills routed to `<project>/.claude/skills/` ride that project's own git — any machine that pulls the
project gets them for free.

**Known limitation**: many repos `.gitignore` the whole `.claude/` dir, in which case a project-scoped
distilled skill is **local-only and never propagates**. Check with `git check-ignore .claude/skills/`.
Two fixes: (a) add a negation to that repo's `.gitignore` so the skills are tracked. **Git cannot
re-include a path whose parent directory is fully excluded** — so `.claude/` + `!.claude/skills/`
does *not* work (the skill stays ignored). Exclude the *contents* with `.claude/*`, then negate:
```gitignore
.claude/*
!.claude/skills/
```
This keeps `.claude/settings.json` etc. ignored while tracking `.claude/skills/`. (Verify:
`git check-ignore .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` should print nothing.)
Or (b) route the skill to the **global pack** instead (it always syncs), accepting it loads in every
project rather than just this one.
