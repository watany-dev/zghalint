# /l3 — CEO autonomy, inline

> Routing overlap? If this intent better matches a sibling skill, redirect per [references/routing-tiebreaks.md](../../references/routing-tiebreaks.md) (prefer explicit commands over conversational autonomy).

Terse front-door into `autopilot:ceo-agent` at **Level 3**: depth-0 writes the
brief and dispatches a `hands` agent (`model: sonnet`, `Engine:` header) inline.

Hard rules:
- Startup pre-filled, never re-asked on a clean goal: OKR from `<goal>`;
  involvement=3 just-results; scope=Hold (`--expand` → Expand); governance mode from the project
  default (`--mode` changes only this run); project red lines plus `-x <csv>` additions.
- Before any TaskCreate, branch, worktree, runner, model, or inline implementation effect, run
  `node <plugin>/scripts/session-mode.js set --level l3 --repo-root <repo>`. The command performs
  canonical Mission policy/graph/source admission before writing its marker. Enforce requires
  `READY`; shadow is disclosed without authority; off remains `LEGACY`.
- Posture: **inline** — depth-0 writes the brief and dispatches a `hands` agent (`model: sonnet`, `Engine:` header) inline on this thread; depth-0 itself does not hand-author product files. `sonnet` is a deliberate step above the `hands` role default (`haiku`, per `scripts/resolve-dispatch.sh --role hands`) because `/l3` units are judgment-class. `/l3` is also the `--solo` degradation target for `/l4`/`/l5`/`/l6`; `--solo` is the only true inline-implements-itself escape and the cost fuse still applies to it.
- The front-door changes startup ONLY — every `ceo-agent` gate (size → project setup
  → admitted deliverables → finish-flow) still applies. Plan headings, modules, tests,
  reviewers, and retries remain coverage/gates inside those deliverables.
