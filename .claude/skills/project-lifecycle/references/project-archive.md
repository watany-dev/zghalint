# Project Archive

> **Trigger**: L-size project completed (after `finishing-a-development-branch`)
> **S-size tasks do not use this flow** — S audit trail lives in `docs/projects/ongoing-maintenance/` (or the project-configured projects path — e.g. `docs/` plural)

## Eligibility Check (before archiving)

A project is eligible for archive when:
- **100% of phases completed**, OR
- **Core phases completed** + remaining phases explicitly recorded in `docs/BACKLOG.md` with trigger conditions

**Cannot archive if**: any incomplete phase is not accounted for in BACKLOG, or deferred items lack trigger conditions.

```
Eligibility check:
├── All phases done? → eligible
├── Core phases done + rest in BACKLOG with triggers? → eligible
└── Incomplete phases not in BACKLOG? → NOT eligible — resolve first
```

## Step 1: README Status Verification (LLM judgment)

Read `docs/projects/{PROJECT}/README.md` and verify:

- [ ] All Phase statuses show completion (not in-progress or pending)
- [ ] Phases moved to Backlog are marked paused with corresponding BACKLOG.md entry
- [ ] Final results/metrics are documented

**If README is incomplete**: update it before proceeding. Do not archive with stale status.

## Step 2: Run Archive Script

```bash
# Run your project's archive script, or follow steps manually:
# node .claude/scripts/project-archive.js --project <dir-name>
```

The script performs: mv to `_archive/` -> update `projects/INDEX.md` (remove + add to archived + update count) -> archive matching plans -> update `plans/INDEX.md`.

**Expected output**:
```json
{
  "archived": true,
  "indexUpdated": true,
  "plansArchived": ["plan-name.md"],
  "errors": [],
  "nextAction": "LLM post-processing required"
}
```

**Verify each field** before proceeding to Step 3.

## Step 3: LLM Post-Processing (Script Cannot Handle)

These items require judgment and must not be skipped:

- [ ] **Proposals archive** — check `docs/proposals/` for related files. If found, move to `docs/proposals/_archive/` and update proposals INDEX if one exists.
- [ ] **`~/.claude/plans/` cleanup** — check for leftover plan files from Plan Mode. Archive to `docs/plans/_archive/`.
- [ ] **BACKLOG.md sync** — **delete** completed items (not strikethrough). Add any newly identified follow-up items with trigger conditions.
- [ ] **Documentation sync** — run `git diff --name-only develop` and verify: if game logic/architecture/proto/skill files changed, corresponding docs are updated.
- [ ] **Mission routing continuity** — if `.claude/mission-routing-config.json` points inside the project directory being moved, update `graph_path` to the archived path in the same archive change. Then run `bash hooks/tests/mission-routing-admission.test.sh` and `bash hooks/tests/session-mode.test.sh`; both must pass before closeout.
- [ ] **MEMORY.md refresh** — update "In Progress" section (remove archived project, add any new state).

## Step 4: Stale Entry Sweep

During archive, scan for orphaned or inconsistent entries across project tracking files:

```bash
# Check for projects still marked Active but with all phases done:
grep -l "in progress" docs/projects/*/README.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for plan files that should have been archived:
ls docs/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v INDEX | grep -v _archive

# Check for empty Active table entries pointing to _archive/:
grep "_archive" docs/projects/INDEX.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for "in progress" markers that should be resolved:
grep -rn "in progress\|In Progress\|IN PROGRESS" docs/projects/INDEX.md 2>/dev/null
```

The sweep above scans INDEX→filesystem. That direction alone cannot see anything the INDEX never
mentioned, so run the reverse direction too — filesystem→INDEX:

```bash
# REVERSE 1: archived project dirs not listed in INDEX
for d in docs/projects/_archive/*/; do
  [ -d "$d" ] || continue
  name=$(basename "$d")
  grep -q "$name" docs/projects/INDEX.md || echo "ORPHAN PROJECT: $name not in INDEX"
done

# REVERSE 2: project dirs whose README says COMPLETE but that never moved to _archive/
for d in docs/projects/*/; do
  case "$(basename "$d")" in _archive|ongoing-maintenance) continue ;; esac
  grep -qi "status.*COMPLETE" "$d/README.md" 2>/dev/null \
    && echo "UNARCHIVED COMPLETE: $(basename "$d") is done but still outside _archive/"
done

# REVERSE 3: branches named in the Active section that no longer exist.
# Scope to the Active table only — the Completed table legitimately names branches that are gone,
# and scanning the whole file reports every one of them as stale.
sed -n '/^## 進行中/,/^## 已完成/p' docs/projects/INDEX.md 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -oE '`(feat|fix|mission)/[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+`' \
  | tr -d '`' | sort -u | while read -r branch; do
  git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$branch" >/dev/null \
    || git rev-parse --verify --quiet "origin/$branch" >/dev/null \
    || echo "STALE BRANCH REF: $branch (deleted — project may be merged but not archived)"
done
```

**For each finding:**
- Orphaned plan file (project already archived) → move to `docs/plans/_archive/`
- Active table entry pointing to `_archive/` → remove from Active, ensure in Archived
- "In progress" marker on completed project → update to final status
- Empty Active table row → remove
- `ORPHAN PROJECT` → add the missing INDEX row; the work happened, only the index lost it
- `UNARCHIVED COMPLETE` → run the archive script on it; a COMPLETE README outside `_archive/` means
  closeout stopped halfway
- `STALE BRANCH REF` → the branch was deleted, so the project was most likely merged but never
  archived; verify the merge, then archive

## Step 5: Invoke next (project-specific)

Auto-trigger after archive completes. Scans all work sources and recommends next action.

## Error Recovery

| Script Error | Diagnosis | Recovery |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `Archive destination already exists` | Duplicate archive attempt or name collision | Check `docs/projects/_archive/` for existing dir. If duplicate, skip mv. If name collision, rename. |
| `indexUpdated: false` | INDEX.md format changed or project entry not found | Manually edit `docs/projects/INDEX.md`: remove from active, add to archived section, update count. |
| `plansArchived: []` (expected plans) | Plan filename does not contain project short name | Manually find plan in `docs/plans/`, move to `docs/plans/_archive/`, update `docs/plans/INDEX.md`. |
| Script crashes (non-JSON output) | Node.js error or missing dependency | Read error message. Common fix: `node --version` check (needs 18+). If script bug, perform steps manually. |
| Partial completion (archived=true but indexUpdated=false) | Script succeeded on mv but failed on INDEX update | Do NOT re-run script (would fail on "already exists"). Manually fix INDEX only. |

## Manual Archive (When Script Unavailable)

If the script fails completely, perform these steps manually:

1. `mv docs/projects/{PROJECT} docs/projects/_archive/`
2. Edit `docs/projects/INDEX.md`: remove from active section, add to archived section
3. Move matching plans: `mv docs/plans/{plan}.md docs/plans/_archive/`
4. Edit `docs/plans/INDEX.md`: update status
5. Proceed with Step 3 (LLM post-processing)
