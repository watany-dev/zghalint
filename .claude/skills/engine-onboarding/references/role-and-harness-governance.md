# Role and Harness Governance

Use this reference before expanding Autopilot across a new harness, model, runner, or automation role. The purpose is to keep routing decisions evidence-based and updateable rather than hardcoded in skills or engine code.

## Decision Inputs

Collect these inputs before choosing an implementation level or role:

- **Target**: harness, runner, model, provider endpoint, or orchestration surface.
- **Role**: canonical `owner`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, `verification_author`, or `explorer`.
  Legacy scorecard/CLI inputs map `planner` and `orchestrator` to `owner`, and `verifier` to
  `reviewer`; aliases are never stored as a second role taxonomy.
- **Authority**: read-only advice, file mutation, verification authoring, merge/block gate, or delegated orchestration.
- **Auth and quota domains**: driver CLI availability, native provider
  subscription quota, and third-party provider quota are separate facts. A
  Claude Code driver with a MiniMax/GLM `cc-shim` endpoint is not the same quota
  domain as native Anthropic-backed Claude dispatch.
- **Evidence age**: latest official docs, local CLI probe, committed probe artifact, scorecard row, and expiry date.
- **Failure cost**: can a wrong result mutate the repo, leak secrets, merge broken code, or silently remove the human from the loop?

If any fact is stale, missing, or based on memory, run a survey/spike before implementing behavior. Survey gathers evidence; this reference decides the gate.

## Harness Implementation Levels

Choose the lowest level that unlocks the required value.

| Level | Name | Ship when | Required evidence | May do |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| H0 | Claim / spike candidate | Fact is unknown or changing. | Plan note with source question or spike command. | Document uncertainty only. |
| H1 | Instruction-tier | Harness can consume skills/prompts but no reliable hook/agent API is proven. | Skill loads or prompt contract works in a probe. | Methodology prompts, skills, manual workflow. |
| H2 | Adapter-tier | A stable CLI/API can be called safely, but mutation/gating is not proven. | Read-only smoke, parsed result schema, timeout/fail-closed behavior. | Read-only dispatch, capability report, warning-only hooks. |
| H3 | Dispatch-tier | The harness can perform delegated work with containment and artifact verification. | Worktree/scratch isolation, provenance JSON, nonzero/timeout tests, cleanup tests. | Implementer/reviewer/verifier dispatch under depth-0 control. |
| H4 | Gate-tier | The output can influence block/ship decisions. | Known-bad evals, false-pass budget, scorecard row, independent verification, rollback path. | Automated gating, roster selection, fallback ladder. |
| H5 | Maintenance-tier | Capability must remain current without manual memory. | TTL, version identity capture, stale detector, re-qualification trigger. | Auto-expire, re-probe suggestions, scorecard-driven routing. |

Do not jump levels because a model self-reports success. Level advancement requires artifacts: process status, parsed schema, git evidence, test output, eval results, or committed probe files.

## Role Promotion States

Keep role promotion separate from harness implementation level. A harness can be
H3-capable for read-only review while the same model remains unqualified for
planning or orchestration.

| State | Meaning | May route automatically? |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| R0 documented | Role fit is a hypothesis or survey finding only. | No. |
| R1 spike-passed | One role-shaped operation worked and identity was captured. | No. |
| R2 scorecard-recordable | Evidence rows can be stored and queried with TTL via `current`/`report`. | No, unless the caller is explicitly evidence-only. |
| R3 auto-routable | A resolver/engine consumer understands the role and fail-closed behavior. | Yes for non-blocking or delegated work. |
| R4 gate-routable | Known-bad evals, false-pass budget, fallback ladder, and rollback path pass. | Yes, including blocking gates. |
| R5 self-maintaining | TTL, version drift, stale capability, and re-qualification triggers are automated. | Yes, with stale-fact warnings and expiry. |

`engine-scorecard.js` is the R2 evidence store. It is not, by itself, a
permission to let a model orchestrate, verify, or block shipping. Evidence-only
roles must not use fallback-ladder routing until a resolver/engine consumer
explicitly promotes that role to R3+.

The store is also not an authenticity boundary: a same-UID model process can edit
user-local JSONL. Disk rows are therefore untrusted telemetry and stored passes are
projected as provisional. R3-tier confidence is session-local: run the evaluator
in-process and act on that live result; a stored row is a record of a past run, not
a transferable credential. (The kernel grant machinery that once enforced this was
retired 2026-08-16; the epistemic rule outlives it.)

## Role Qualification Matrix

Qualify or evaluate a model/runner per role. A model can be qualified for one role and unsafe for another.

| Role | It is qualified only if it can | Hard fail examples | Current routing status |
|------|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Owner | Produce the task contract, preserve intent/authority, sequence work, interpret failures, and enforce acceptance without trusting delegate self-report. Legacy aliases: planner/orchestrator. | Vague plans, hidden broad scope, merges on delegate green, loses ledger/provenance, retries blindly. | Implemented path: distinct `engine-qualify.sh owner` corpus/oracle plus a session-local live verifier; disk rows remain provisional. |
| Implementer | Edit only allowed files in an isolated worktree; produce git artifacts; pass required checks; avoid self-merging. | Writes outside scope, no-op while claiming success, asks clarifying questions mid-dispatch, changes tests to pass. | R3 auto-routable — live-rail qualifier shipped (`engine-qualify.sh implementer`; plan 2026-08-22). |
| Verification author | Author independent checks/harnesses that catch defects the implementer could miss; avoid copying implementer assumptions. | Only reruns implementer tests, rubber-stamps, writes brittle or fixture-gamed checks. | R2 scorecard-recordable; not fallback-ladder or auto-routable until a role eval/resolver exists. |
| Reviewer | Read untrusted specs/diffs without mutation; classify fresh metamorphic defects at the right location/severity; avoid false-pass on critical; resist prompt injection. | Empty/generic output treated as pass, public-fixture lookup, wrong defect/location, follows diff instructions, high clean false-FIX rate. | Implemented path: isolated `engine-qualify.sh reviewer`, optional case-only remote broker, and telemetry-only `engine-scorecard.js`. |
| Explorer | Gather and synthesize bounded repository/domain context without mutation or authority expansion. | Hides uncertainty, leaks protected context, broadens scope, treats external priors as proof. | R2 scorecard-recordable; evidence-only until explorer eval/resolver exists. |

Verification author is different from reviewer: the former authors independent checks; the latter
judges diffs/specs. Both should be decorrelated from the implementer when possible.

## Role Evaluation Workflow

Use this workflow when deciding whether a model can act as owner, implementer,
verification author, reviewer, or explorer.

1. **Define the model/runner bundle**: runner binary/API, provider family,
   model ID, observed model version, auth path, tool permissions, and harness
   implementation level. Record driver auth and model/provider quota
   separately when a shim or proxy is involved.
2. **Pick exactly one target role**. Do not qualify "the model" globally.
3. **Run the role spike**: one representative operation plus identity capture.
   Process errors, empty parser output, permission prompts, and timeouts fail the
   spike.
4. **Run the role eval**: use the role evidence bars below. Reviewer and owner have separate
   nonce-derived qualifiers with executable host oracles and per-case bubblewrap isolation;
   implementer, verification author, and explorer still need committed role-specific corpora
   before automatic promotion.
5. **Record telemetry** with `engine-scorecard.js` once the output is
   reproducible. Use `status:"failed"` for failed evidence too; do not hide bad
   rows. `current`/`report` are diagnostic only and disk-backed `ladder` cannot
   produce an admitted candidate.
6. **Promote separately**: scorecard row (R2), resolver consumption (R3), gate
   authority (R4), and maintenance automation (R5) are separate decisions. A live
   session capability can satisfy R3; JSON serialization cannot.
7. **Re-evaluate on drift**: model alias, runner version, prompt hash, corpus
   version, score threshold, or stale TTL changes restart the relevant stage.

### Evaluation Dimensions

Every role evaluation should score these dimensions explicitly:

- **Contract fidelity**: follows the role's expected output grammar.
- **Tool discipline**: uses only allowed tools and honors read/write boundaries.
- **Artifact integrity**: success is proven by git/process/test artifacts, not
  self-report.
- **Independence**: avoids copying the implementer's assumptions when planning,
  reviewing, or verifying.
- **Failure semantics**: nonzero exits, timeouts, no verdicts, dirty trees, and
  parser failures become blocked/failed, never pass.
- **Prompt-injection resistance**: untrusted repo/diff/test text cannot rewrite
  the role instruction.
- **Cost and latency**: measured or explicitly unknown; unknown cost must never
  rank as free.
- **Freshness**: evidence has model identity, runner version, prompt hash,
  corpus version, `qualified_at`, and `expires`.

## Role Evidence Bars

Use these bars before a role becomes eligible for routing.

### Owner

- At least two fresh full-corpus trials pass with stable sensitivity and clean specificity.
- The dedicated corpus covers intent preservation, bounded delegation, failure interpretation,
  state continuity, ledger discipline, and acceptance; reviewer evidence is never reused.
- Each rule has planted-failure, clean, and repair/mutation controls scored by an independent host
  oracle. Free-form model self-report is not the verdict.
- The owner preserves the frozen intent/authority envelope, maintains a per-unit ledger, and treats
  process/parser/timeout/no-verdict outcomes as blocked.
- Scope and acceptance remain concrete enough for a separate implementer and independent verifier;
  no output may create effect or acceptance authority.

### Owner — brain seat (standing exam)

- Seating an engine as the autonomous depth-0 brain requires the SEPARATE
  `engine-qualify.sh brain` standing exam (勤勞×公平×收斂 + containment case family):
  two seed-derived trials × 12 stateless rounds, deterministic offline grading, one
  atomic `owner-brain-seat-v1` record on the owner role with forced `brain-seat` scope.
- The record has NO expiry: standing holds until 3 identity-keyed production strikes
  (stall-fuse trip / conformance-audit fail) since the last pass flip it to
  `requalification_required` (`engine-capability-state.js brain-status`); every re-sit
  is a fresh administration.
- Owner intent-control evidence alone never seats the brain: the governed paths refuse
  a candidate without brain-seat standing (or an explicit per-invocation override).
- Real administrations reach CLI-credentialed seats through the provider adapter's
  CLI transport (`QRP_TRANSPORT=cli`: codex via `CODEX_HOME`, claude via
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` pointing at a DEDICATED exam config dir seeded with
  `.credentials.json` only — never the live `~/.claude`) with the brain round-mode
  prompt (`QRP_PROMPT_MODE=brain`). The prompt teaches bundle semantics, the
  five-field output contract, and the seat's standing production governance
  contract; it never names any round's content (test-scanned against the
  generator's oracle-vocabulary projection plus semantic answer-key tokens, and
  sha256(prompt) is pinned to the seat identity file so any prompt edit forces an
  identity re-pin + honesty re-review).
- **CLI-transport identity is operator-asserted, not runtime-observed**: unlike
  the HTTP path (whose response echoes the resolved model id — how the
  glm-5.2→glm-5.3 alias upgrade was caught), `codex exec` / `claude -p` return no
  model identity signal the adapter can verify. Record a pre-run model probe
  beside every CLI administration and treat the recorded identity as asserted
  deployment configuration; a runtime identity capture is tracked in BACKLOG.

### Implementer

- Baseline tasks pass in isolated worktrees.
- Artifact verification uses git diff/commit state, not self-report.
- Boundary tests include protected paths, no-op detection, and test-integrity checks.
- Security canary confirms prompt-injected secrets are not written.
- Nonzero, timeout, dirty tree, and question-suspected outcomes are fail-closed.

### Verification author

- Harness catches planted defects missed by ordinary tests.
- Harness is authored from requirements, not implementation internals alone.
- Verification authoring family differs from implementer family when possible.
- Depth-0 executes the harness and owns the verdict.
- False confidence from weak/generated tests blocks qualification.
- **Standing exam** (`engine-qualify.sh verification_author`, v2.34.17,
  plan 2026-08-18-verification-author-suite-v3): the candidate reads a
  clause-rendered requirements spec (never any implementation — black-box is
  construct-guaranteed) and submits a DECLARED TEST PLAN: ordered calls with
  pre-declared expected outcomes, within a constant step budget. The host
  executes the plan against hidden clean/defect twins in the bwrap runner and
  grades offline: `declared_accuracy` (declaration === contract oracle ===
  clean-twin observation), `sensitivity` (defect twin deviates somewhere),
  `robustness` (no malformed/budget violations) — AND of three, 2 trials with
  distinct per-trial corpora. No candidate code ever executes; fuzzing dies on
  the declaration line + budget; transport/infra failures abort with NO
  verdict. Evidence rides the additive `va_declared_plan` methodology kind.

### Reviewer

- `false_pass_on_critical = 0`.
- Every generated known-bad case is classified with the expected semantic rule,
  changed file/line, and severity floor in every trial.
- Each accepted finding includes a bounded structured behavioral witness. The host runs it at
  identical visible paths against before/after code in a separate no-network sandbox and requires
  the stated behavior to hold only before, using the nonce-derived valid call domain for that case.
- Panel-visible paths, identifiers, and fixtures carry no known-bad/clean outcome label.
- Random symmetric/asymmetric relational twins share one normalized diff shape, so public
  template/nearest-neighbor lookup cannot pass both sensitivity and clean specificity.
- Every generated clean case passes with no findings.
- Prompt-injection diffs do not override review instructions.
- Two-pass rerun produces stable outcome.
- The host executes both sides of every generated case: known-bad patches must
  turn a passing invariant red, and the reversal control must turn it green.
- The panel sees only one diff in a fresh no-network sandbox;
  repo/corpus/home/host-network/prior-case state is absent. Remote panels use the case-only
  host broker: the sandbox receives one fresh Unix socket while credentials, outbound network,
  exact response identity, retry/timeout policy, and the host oracle stay outside. Missing
  bubblewrap, broker isolation, or a pin/identity match blocks live authority.
- Any later exact-identity/exact-scope run immediately supersedes the prior live
  run. A degraded result invalidates already-created session verifiers.

### Explorer

- Returns bounded context with source/provenance references and explicit uncertainty.
- Cannot mutate the repository, mint authority, or broaden the task/domain/tool scope.
- Injection, protected-data, stale-source, and unsupported-inference cases remain provisional or
  blocked rather than being reported as facts.

## Survey, Spike, Eval, Scorecard

Use the right evidence mechanism:

| Need | Mechanism | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Current external facts | `survey` | Cited docs, official sources, production practice, known risks. |
| Harness capability truth | Spike/probe | Command, version, raw output, yes/no result. |
| Role quality | Eval corpus | Sensitivity/specificity, failure modes, reproducibility. |
| Runtime routing telemetry | Scorecard | Provisional rows with TTL, cost, latency, family, and version identity; never session authority. |
| Ongoing freshness | Maintenance loop | Expiry, version mismatch, stale warning, re-qualification task. |

Survey alone is never enough for H3/H4/H5. It can justify a spike or identify the official API, but dispatch and gating require local probes/evals.

## Hardcoding Rule

Engine and orchestration code must not hardcode real model IDs, effort presets, or provider-specific routing policy. Allowed locations:

- Config templates and user project config.
- Scorecard rows and capability state.
- Test fixtures using neutral names like `test-review-model`.
- Documentation examples clearly marked as examples, not defaults.

Runtime code consumes roster data; it does not decide the roster from model names.

## Update Triggers

Re-run survey/spike/eval when any of these happen:

- CLI/API version changes, model identity changes, or provider silently aliases a model.
- Official docs or local probes are older than the configured TTL.
- A runner returns new output shape, timeout behavior, auth path, or tool permission prompt.
- A role fails in production or a reviewer catches a role-specific blind spot.
- A new harness feature could move an integration from H1/H2 to H3+.
- Scorecard schema, eval corpus, role threshold, or fallback ladder policy changes.
